# SALES-ANALYSIS
This project focuses on the analysis of pizza sales data over a year, using an interactive dashboard to provide key business insights. 
The dashboard highlights important metrics such as total revenue, average order value, total pizzas sold, and total orders placed. Key trends are visualized, including the daily and monthly sales trends, allowing for a better understanding of peak sales periods and customer behavior.

The project also breaks down sales performance by pizza category (e.g., Classic, Supreme, Chicken, Veggie) and pizza size (e.g., Large, Medium, Regular), helping businesses identify which products contribute the most to total sales. Additionally, the dashboard shows the busiest days and times, with a specific focus on Fridays and Saturdays, and maximum order volume in the months of July and January.

This interactive dashboard is designed to provide actionable insights to optimize inventory, improve sales strategies, and enhance customer satisfaction by focusing on high-demand categories and sizes.
